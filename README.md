#Machine learning-deep learning

The project deals with the application of three different neural networks to
perform binary classification on a dataset collecting colored images depicting
chihuahuas and muffins. Specifically, the convolutional architectures considered are, in order of complexity, Lenet-5, a simplified version of Alexnet and
the full Alexnet. As suspected, performance is inversely related with modelâ€™s
parsimony and the best score is achieved by the full Alexnet architecture. The
code is implemented in Pyhton and the libraries used for building, training
and testing the networks are mainly TensorFlow and Keras.
